# [Arasaka Inferno - Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=puszkarek.arasaka-inferno-vscode-theme)

_"Wake up, Samurai. We’ve got code to burn."_

A VS Code theme that plunges your editor into the neon-soaked, corporate dystopia of **Night City**. Built for netrunners, chromed-up coders, and anyone who’d rather burn Arasaka than write a single line of legacy code.
