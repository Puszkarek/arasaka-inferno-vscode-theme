# [Arasaka Inferno - Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=puszkarek.arasaka-inferno-vscode-theme)

_"Wake up, Samurai. Weâ€™ve got code to burn."_

A cyberpunk VS Code theme inspired by Cyberpunk 2077 that plunges your editor into the neon-drenched, corporate dystopia of **Night City**. Built for netrunners, chromed-up coders, and anyone who'd rather burn Arasaka than write a single line of legacy code.

**Keywords:** cyberpunk, Cyberpunk 2077, Night City, Arasaka, dark theme, neon, retro-futuristic, dystopian, hacker theme, chrome, corporate rebellion, VS Code theme
